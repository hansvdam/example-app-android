# Verifai SDK Android example app
This repository contains an example implementation of the Verifai SDK. The Verifai SDK can be used to verify the identity of users. This can be done by scanning passports or other identification documents with the camera of the Android device. Not sure what it does yet? Download our demo from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.verifai.demo).



The latest docs of the SDK can be found over here: [https://docs.verifai.com/android_docs/android-sdk-latest.html](https://docs.verifai.com/android_docs/android-sdk-latest.html). 

Feel free to submit issues, pull requests and/or [contact our support](https://www.verifai.com/en/support/). A Verifai license is needed to make this example work. Request a license at [https://dashboard.verifai.com](https://dashboard.verifai.com).
